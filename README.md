# DemoBlaze-automated-SmokeTest

## **Features**

- Utilizes Playwright test framework for fast, reliable browser automation.
- Supports both local and containerized test execution.
- Configurable base URL for flexible environment targeting.
- Dockerized setup with HTML report server exposed on port 9323.
- CI integration via GitHub Actions with artifact publishing.
- Modular test structure with page object model for maintainability.
- Includes robust handling for modal interactions and flaky UI elements.

---

## **Requirements**

- Node.js must be installed on the machine that runs this test.  
  You can install Node.js via command line. For installation instructions, see [**Node.js official website**](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

- Docker and Docker Compose (for containerized runs).  
  See [**Docker installation guide**](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for setup instructions.

## **Inputs**

### **`Base URL`**
- **Description**: URL to the website that is to be tested.  
- **Required**: No.  
- **Type**: String.

Provide the URL to, for instance, `https://www.amazon.co.uk` to overwrite the default `https://www.demoblaze.com`.

---

## **Outputs**

### **`Test results`**
- **Description**: Result of tests ran on different browsers.
- **Format**: HTML report generated by Playwright.
- **Location**:
  - Locally: `playwright-report/`
  - Docker: Accessible via `http://localhost:9323`
  - GitHub Actions: Published as downloadable artifact

---

## **Environments to Run**

- ✅ **Local machine**  
  Run tests headlessly or in headed mode using Playwright CLI.

- ✅ **Docker container**  
  Run tests in a containerized environment. HTML report is served on port 9323.

- ✅ **GitHub Actions**  
  CI pipeline runs tests on every push and pull request to `main`. Test results are uploaded as artifacts.

---

## **Usage**

### 🔧 Local Run

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install --with-deps
```
Run tests (headed mode):

```bash
npx playwright test --headed
```
Run tests (headless mode):

```bash
npx playwright test
```
Open HTML report after local run:

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```
Override base URL:

```bash
BASE_URL="https://www.amazon.co.uk/" npx playwright test
```
## **🐳 Docker Run**
Build and run the container:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```
View the report in your browser:

```Code
http://localhost:9323
```
To stop the container:

```bash
Ctrl+C
```
## **🚀 GitHub Actions CI**
Tests run automatically on:

- **Push to main**

- **Pull request to main**

- **Manual trigger via workflow dispatch**

### Artifacts:

- **HTML report is uploaded and retained for 30 days.**

## **Issues**
If you encounter flaky tests or modal-related failures in CI, refer to the modal handling logic in NavBar.ts and ContactPage.ts. These have been hardened to work reliably in headless environments.

## **Roadmap**
This project is a proof of concept for smoke testing with Playwright. Future enhancements may include:

✅ GitHub annotations for inline test warnings and errors.

✅ Slack or Teams integration for alerting on critical failures.

✅ Parallel test execution across browsers and devices.

✅ Environment matrix for staging vs production testing.

✅ Trace viewer integration for debugging flaky tests.

✅ Auto-publish HTML reports to GitHub Pages.
